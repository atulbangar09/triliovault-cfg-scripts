Rev 1.2 changes:
While running hf_upgrade.sh script in offline mode. We need to change the BRANCH_NAME inside hf_upgrade.sh script to download the package from correct location.

For end customer usage set BRANCH_NAME="triliodata-4-2" inside hf_upgade.sh script.
For internal testing set BRANCH_NAME="triliodata-hotfix-4-2" inside hf_upgrade.sh script.

Make the above mentioned change in hf_upgrade.sh script with following steps, 
	- open hf_upgrade.sh script using any familier editor
	- Go to line number#7 in hf_upgrade.sh script and edit the file to change the value for BRANCH_NAME
	- For end customer usage set it to BRANCH_NAME="triliodata-4-2"
	- For internal testing set it to BRANCH_NAME="triliodata-hotfix-4-2"
	- Save the changes and run the hf_upgade.sh script using -d option / -i option / -a option.


Note:
	If end user is running this script manually on TVM then please make sure you run it on the primary node so that wlm-cron service will get reloaded properly. 
	To make sure if it is a primary node or not, perform following commands.
	- Run pcs status command on TVM
	- Check the output and see the value of Current DC:
	- Run the hostname command the check the value with Current DC output. If it is matched then it is a primary node.
